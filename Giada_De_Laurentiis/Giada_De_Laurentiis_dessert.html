      <li>5 tablespoons sugar</li>
      <li>1/2cup imported sweet Marsala</li>
      <li>1/2 cup plus ⅓ cup chilled heavy whipping cream</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon kosher salt</li>

        <h3>Instrcutions</h3>
      </div>

      <ol>
        <li>Whisk the egg yolks and sugar in a medium stainless steel bowl until blended. Whisk in Marsala, 1/2 cup cream, and salt.</li>
        <li>Place the bowl over a large saucepan of simmering water (do not let the bottom of the bowl touch the water).</li>
        <li>Whisk constantly until the sauce is thick and a thermometer inserted into the sabayon registers 160°F to 170°F, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the bowl from over the water. Add the chocolate morsels and whisk until they are melted and the sabayon is smooth and blended</li>
        <li>Whisk the remaining 1/3 cup cream and the mascarpone in another medium bowl until peaks form. Dice cake into small cubes.</li>
        <li>Place about 1/2 cup of the cake cubes into each of six 1 1/2- to 2-cup old-fashioned glasses or water goblets.</li>
        <li>Spoon 2 heaping tablespoons sabayon over the cake. Top with a spoonful of the mascarpone cream. </li>
        <li>Repeat the layering with cake, sabayon, and mascarpone cream.</li>
      </ol>

        <h3> Extra Instrcutions</h3>
      </div>
        <ol>
          <li>To make the chocolate curls, stand the chocolate bar in a large measuring cup</li>
          <li>Microwave on 50% power in 10-second intervals just until the chocolate feels a bit warm</li>
          <li>Stand the chocolate bar upright and run a vegetable peeler down one narrow edge, creating off chocolate curls</li>
          <li>Sprinkle the curls over each tiramisu and serve.</li>
