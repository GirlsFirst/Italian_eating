      <p> Hélène Darroze is part of a family of hotel and restaurant owners. Yet she didn't realize she wanted to be a chef until her mid-twenties. At first, she was convinced she would become the general manager of the family-owned Relais & Château, following in the footsteps of her father. But she was a good student, so she went to college and graduated from Sup de Co Bordeaux with a BA in Business. To complete her education, she decided to work in a palace where she met Alain Ducasse and her career took another direction.   </p>
