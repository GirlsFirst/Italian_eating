      <h3>Ingredients for Apple Mixture</h3>

      <h3>Ingredients for Dough</h3>

    <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
    <li>200 ml beer</li>

      <ol>
        <li>Whisk the egg whites in snow.</li>
        <li>Place the flour and salt into a bowl. Add beer and milk, mix gently until smooth. Then gently add the egg  whites to the mixture. Let it stand for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, peel the apples and then empty them with an apple cutter. Then cut thick slices of 7-8 mm into the width of the fruit. Put them in a dish and cover them with a dish towel while waiting to cook them.</li>
        <li>Heat the cooking oil to 355 degrees F. Dip the apple slices in the dough. Depending on the size of the fryer, so that the fritters do not stick together, proceed by 4 or 6 slices at a time. Remove them when they are well covered with dough, drain them slightly and then put them in the cooking oil.</li>
        <li>Remove the fritters with a spider when they are golden brown and crispy. Drain them on paper towels and sprinkle them with sugar-vanilla sugar mixture. Put them in a dish and serve immediately.</li>
      </ol>
