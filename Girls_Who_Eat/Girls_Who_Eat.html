      <div class="column" style="width: 35%; float: left;"><p>What's up everyone, my name is Ayiana Jones. I'm one of the creators of Famous Female Cuisine. What I love the most about this project was Working as a team to get things done and learning each other differences. From this project, we've all grown closer to each other. They are my sister and I love them.</p></div>
      <div class="column" style="width: 35%; float: right;"><p>My name is Melissa Sarabando and I am one of the creators of Famous Female Cuisine. My team and I decided to make this website to highlight some amazing female chefs that don't get as much credit as the male ones. As a food lover, my team and I decided on two of our favorite cuisines to do for this website such as French and Italian. Working with these people could not have been a better experience because working with them was like working with my sisters. The cooperation and collaboration could not have gone smoother. I loved it!</p></div>
      <div class="column" style="width: 35%; float: left;"><p>My name is Betty Montesino and I'm also one of the creators of Famous Female Cuisine. I really enjoyed coding and working with these amazing young ladies. I definitely learned a lot about teamwork and sisterhood. I really enjoyed this opportunity and being able to have more knowledge about coding.</p></div>
      <div class="column" style="width: 35%; float: right;"><p>Hey! My name is Gabriella. 1/4 of the creators for this page. The time we took to make this website couldn't have been more fun. We were pushed to face challenges and had to independently, and as a group, figure out how to overcome these bumps in the road no matter how time-consuming the process of debugging can be. I love food and web development thus the creation of "Famous Female Cuisine". We hope you enjoyed the time spent on our webpage. </p></div>
