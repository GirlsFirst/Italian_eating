      <div class="column" style="width: 35%; float: right;"><p>My name is Melissa Saiabando and I am one of the creators for Famous Female Cuisine. Me and my team decided to make this website to highlight some amazing  female chefs that don't get as much credit as males. As a food lover, me and my team decided on two of our favorite cuisines to do such as French and Italian. Working with these people could not have been a better experince because working with them was like working with my sisters. I loved it!</p></div>
      <div class="column" style="width: 35%; float: left;"><p>My name is Betty Montesino and I'm also one of the creators for Famous Female Cuisine. I really enjoyed coding and working with these amazing young ladies. I definitely learned a lot about teamwork and sisterhood. I really enjoyed this opportunity and being able to have more knowledge about coding.</p></div>
      <div class="column" style="width: 35%; float: right;"><p>Hey! My name is Gabriella. 1/4 of the creators for this page. The time we took to make this website coiuldn't have been more fun. We were pushed to face challenges and had to independently, and as a group, figure out how to overcome these bumps in the road no matter how time consuming the process of debugging can be. I love food and web development thus the creation of "Famous Female Cuisine". We hope you enjoyed the time spent on our webpage. </p></div>
