          <li>Preheat the oven to 160°C/gas mark 3. Grease a 26cm tart tin with a generous amount of butter.</li>
          <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar and salt. Pour the cream in a separate bowl.</li>
          <li>Dip your fingers in the cream and rub some of the dry mixture between your hands until you get some sticky crumbs of dough.</li>
          <li>Drop the crumbs into the greased tart pan. Carry on this way until you’ve finished all the flour and sugar mixture, add more if needed.</li>
          <li>Gently flatten the crumbs so as to form a layer that covers the entire surface of the tart pan.</li>
          <li>Top with almonds and press them into the dough to make them stick.</li>
          <li>Bake the fregolotta for 40–45 minutes, or until deeply golden. Allow to cool completely before serving. Serve in chunks</li>
        </ol>
